# Laravel 5 Modular Example

Setup Laravel 5 in a module structure to separate concerns with psr-4 Namespacing and a service provider.

## Information
This example repo includes a full fresh Laravel 5 install with the modifications in proceeding commits. The Laravel 5 install root is in the `src` folder.

This repo will be used to further integration examples towards a typical functioning app use case.
